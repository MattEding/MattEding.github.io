title: About
---

I am Matt Eding and love exploring and pushing the limits of the Python
language. Additionally I have familiarity in Haskell (go itertools!), C++, and
JavaScript to gain insights into other language idioms and paradigms. As a
graduate in Mathematics from UC Santa Cruz I, love looking for interesting problems
to solve in creative ways.

I have studied a wide "array" (love puns too) of data science fields including
regression, classification, natural language processing, and evolutionary
algorithms. Feel free to check out projects I have done on [my GitHub](https://github.com/MattEding).

I am always looking to learn new topics and when I find something I am unfamiliar
with, I seek to read up on literature to become proficient at it. Computer science
books I have read include the following in no particular order:

- Fluent Python
- Python Cookbook
- Algorithms in a Nutshell
- Python for Data Analysis
- Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow
- Elegant Python
- Learn You a Haskell for Greater Good
- Elegant JavaScript
- High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans
- Scipy and NumPy
- Effective Computation in Physics
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
- Learning SQL
